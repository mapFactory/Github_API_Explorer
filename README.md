## How to use.
#### Convert your repo with many subfolders into a map... with the subfolders as repo's
<br>(0) Clone Github-Map
<br>(1) cd into Github-Map
<br>(2) <b>command:</b> rake Github_Map
<br>... we will clone the folder on the primary account input into the program.
<br>and change the folder structure into a Github Map so that subfolders are made repos. And the organization <br>persists with the resultant repository having submodules to those previous subfolders.

#### Make a map locally and we will build it for you.
